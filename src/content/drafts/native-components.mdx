We recently had the chance to create a new library using React Native's new renderer, Fabric, and we thought of documenting this milestone. Our hope is for this post to be useful to anyone wanting to create their own native component.

Keep in mind, <span class="underline">this is not your usual post you read diagonally to get an idea of how native components work</span>, rather, it's a step-by-step guide with lots of code snippets, diffs, and sidenotes for the ones who truly want to dive deep into the world of building native components with React Native.

## The library

For the sake of this post, we will create a new native library to edit images. The component we will create here is nothing but a simplified version of our own image edition library: [Sorolla](https://github.com/antropia-studio/sorolla). Feel free to visit the project to watch a more complete implementation of the things we will go through in this post.

The library will provide two silly features:

1. Hand-draw on top of an image.
2. Tint an image with a random color.

We picked these because they will help us go through the three basic mechanisms to interact with our Fabric components: **props**, **callbacks** and **commands**.

## On Fabric and the new architecture

In case you missed it, in October 2024 the React Native team anounced that their big redesign of React Native had come to an end. They called it the **[New Architecture](https://reactnative.dev/architecture/landing-page)‚Ñ¢Ô∏è**, and it came with some niceties to the framework:

- **Bye bye asynchronous bridge**: Communication between the native layer and the JS layer is now done through JSI rather than using an asynchronous, JSON-serialized, event-driven queue. Removing serialization, and turning the communication synchronous has [a noticeable impact on performance](https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-new-architecture/discussions/123).
- **Synchronous layout**: The new architecture makes it possible to run layout effects synchronously with [`useLayoutEffect`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useLayoutEffect). That removes the hacks required to prevent the unpopular split-second layout-related flickering.
- **Concurrent rendering**: Let's welcome `Suspense` (finally!) and other React 18 features like [transitions](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition) or [auto-batching](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18#new-feature-automatic-batching).

As part of this new architecture, the React Native team created a new renderer: **[Fabric](https://reactnative.dev/architecture/fabric-renderer)**. This is what we will use to create our new native component.

## Kickoff

Let's get things started! We are going to use [`create-react-native-library`](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-builder-bob/create) to create a new Fabric component. Just to give you some context, the library is part of Callstack's [`react-native-builder-bob`](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-builder-bob), a fantastic set of tools to create and maintain RN libraries.

Without further ado, let's create our library by running `create-react-native-library`.

```shell
npx create-react-native-library@latest react-native-silly-image-editor
```

<p class="footnote">Because we are using the latest version, keep in mind some things in this guide might change</p>

You will see many options to configure the library as you want. The most important option for this guide is the one to decide which kind of library we want: a Fabric view.

![Select fabric view from the menu](/blog/native-components/fabric_view.png)

<p class="footnote">Take your time filling in all the settings for your library</p>

By default, `created-react-native-library` uses [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) but this can be changed by your preferred package manager. I personally use [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) nowadays, at least until `npm` catches up with some of the great things `pnpm` does. Just remember to find all `yarn` calls around the generated code and replacing them by your thing. In this guide we will do the switch to `pnpm`, first replace `yarn` by `pnpm` in all the obvious places like Github actions and the `package.json` scripts. Finally, add the following two files to your repository to save you some headaches:

```ini title=".npmrc"
hoist=false
shamefully-hoist=true
```

```yaml title="pnpm-workspaces.yaml"
packages:
  - 'example'
```

<p class="footnote">For some reason, react native does not like symlinks in node_modules. I know (or should I say
  "sense") this configuration is far from ideal, but it has been the quickest way to get the project working with
  `pnpm`.</p>

If you followed these steps, you will be able now to run the example app with `pnpm run --filter react-native-silly-image-editor-example [start/android/ios]`.

## Project structure

To start changing things in our new library, we first need to understand where things are located.

```
react-native-silly-image-editor
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ android                                    üìò Native Android code (Gradle + Kotlin)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ example                                    üìò Example app to test your library (regular RN project)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ios                                        üìò Native iOS code (XCode + Objective-C)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src                                        üìò JS/TS code for your library
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.tsx                              üìò Your project exports
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SillyImageEditorViewNativeComponent.ts üìò Codegen specification for your component
‚îî SillyImageEditor.podspec                     üìò Pod specification for iOS consumers of your library
```

<p class="footnote">This rather incomplete tree will help you understand the tools you will be using in each part of the
  library</p>

All our TS code lives in the `src` directory. The most important file here is the codegen spec file. This file declares the API with the native side and will be used by [`codegen`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/the-new-architecture/what-is-codegen) to create interfaces in Kotlin and Objective-C to communicate between layers. This code will be created in the `android` and `ios` directories, where all our native code will be.

Finally, the `example` folder contains the example app which we will use, not only for testing purposes, but also to fire up our editors to tweak the native code of our library. I promise we'll get there soon but, for now, just remember that to edit your Kotlin or Objective-C/Swift code, you will be opening the example app with your editor, rather than the `android` and `ios` directories.

## Adding a URI prop

Let's jump into the first communication mechanism we have to build our native libraries: **component props**. It is the simplest, and most natural way to pass information to our native components. To do this, we will specify a `uri` prop to load an image in the native side.

The default project is already using this mechanism to send a `color` prop (remember the green square?) so sending a URI instead is as easy as replacing that prop in our spec file:

```diff title="SillyImageEditorViewNativeComponent.ts"
 import type { ViewProps } from 'react-native';

 interface NativeProps extends ViewProps {
-  color?: string;
+  uri?: string;
 }

 export default codegenNativeComponent<NativeProps>('SillyImageEditorView');
```

<p className="footnote">There is no real need to declare `uri` optional but it will make things a bit easier on the
  example app.</p>

Remember, every time we change the spec file we need to run `codegen` that will automatically generate for us the interfacing layer to communicate with Kotlin and Objective-C. Let's run it with `pnpm run prepare`. Strictly speaking, we are calling [`react-native-builder-bob`](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-builder-bob), that is using `codegen` internally. If you want to run `codegen` and `codegen` only (which is very useful when faced with `codegen` errors), add a new script to your project:

```diff title="package.json"
   "scripts": {
     "clean": "del-cli android/build example/android/build example/android/app/build example/ios/build lib",
+    "codegen": "react-native codegen",
     "example": "pnpm --filter react-native-silly-image-editor-example run start",
     "lint": "pnpm run lint:types && pnpm run lint:eslint",
     "lint:types": "tsc --noEmit",
```

Finally, let's change the example app so that we load an image from the media library. We first add `react-native-image-picker` as a dependency of the example app.

```shell
pnpm install --filter react-native-silly-image-editor-example react-native-image-picker
```

And let's implement a basic image picker in the app:

```typescript jsx title="example/src/App.tsx"
import {
  Dimensions,
  StyleSheet,
  Text,
  TouchableOpacity,
  View,
} from 'react-native';
import { SillyImageEditorView } from 'react-native-silly-image-editor';
import { useCallback, useState } from 'react';
import { launchImageLibrary } from 'react-native-image-picker';

export default function App() {
  const [imageUri, setImageUri] = useState<string | undefined>();

  const pickImage = useCallback(async () => {
    const response = await launchImageLibrary({
      mediaType: 'photo',
      selectionLimit: 1,
    });

    const assets = response.assets ?? [];
    if (assets.length === 0) return;

    setImageUri(assets[0]!.uri);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <SillyImageEditorView uri={imageUri} style={styles.box} />
      <TouchableOpacity onPress={pickImage} style={styles.button}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>Pick image</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#0d0d0d',
  },
  box: {
    width: Dimensions.get('window').width,
    height: '70%',
  },
  button: {
    paddingHorizontal: 20,
    paddingVertical: 10,
    backgroundColor: '#0030FF',
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 20,
    color: '#fff',
  },
});
```

### Android

It's time to load the URI in our native Android code. I recommend using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) for this section, but use the editor that better suits your needs. Now, as I told you before, we will be opening the `example/android` app rather than loading the `android` library directly. This is because we will be building the app all the time to test our changes in an emulator.

Now if you followed me here with the `pnpm` switch, you will need to do some changes to the Android project before continuing:

```diff title="example/package.json"
     "@react-native-community/cli-platform-android": "15.0.1",
     "@react-native-community/cli-platform-ios": "15.0.1",
     "@react-native/babel-preset": "0.78.0",
+    "@react-native/codegen": "^0.78.0",
+    "@react-native/gradle-plugin": "^0.78.0",
     "@react-native/metro-config": "0.78.0",
     "@react-native/typescript-config": "0.78.0",
     "react-native-builder-bob": "^0.37.0"
```

```diff title="example/android/settings.gradle"
-pluginManagement { includeBuild("../node_modules/@react-native/gradle-plugin") }
+pluginManagement { includeBuild(file("../node_modules/@react-native/gradle-plugin").toPath().toRealPath().toAbsolutePath().toString()) }
 plugins { id("com.facebook.react.settings") }
 extensions.configure(com.facebook.react.ReactSettingsExtension){ ex -> ex.autolinkLibrariesFromCommand() }
 rootProject.name = 'sillyimageeditor.example'
 include ':app'
-includeBuild('../node_modules/@react-native/gradle-plugin')
+includeBuild(file("../node_modules/@react-native/gradle-plugin").toPath().toRealPath().toAbsolutePath().toString())
```

With that, I recommend running the first build in the command line by running:

```shell
pnpm run --filter react-native-silly-image-editor-example start # üëà in a different terminal to keep it running
pnpm run --filter react-native-silly-image-editor-example android
```

From now on, all builds can be made within Android Studio itself and if, at any point, that doesn't work, you can always resort to CLI commands whenever you need.

Let's prepare our native code to load an `ImageView` and properly set the uri that comes from the props. The native projects consist of two main components: the view manager, that handles all the back and forth communication with our TS code, and the view itself, the thing we are rendering on the screen.

```diff title="android/src/main/java/com/sillyimageeditor/SillyImageEditorViewManager.kt"
     return SillyImageEditorView(context)
   }

-  @ReactProp(name = "color")
-  override fun setColor(view: SillyImageEditorView?, color: String?) {
-    view?.setBackgroundColor(Color.parseColor(color))
+  @ReactProp(name = "uri")
+  override fun setUri(view: SillyImageEditorView?, uri: String?) {
+    uri ?: return
+
+    view?.setImage(uri)
   }

   companion object {
```

```kotlin title="android/src/main/java/com/sillyimageeditor/SillyImageEditorView.kt"
package com.sillyimageeditor

import android.content.Context
import android.net.Uri
import android.util.AttributeSet
import android.view.LayoutInflater
import android.view.View
import android.widget.ImageView
import android.widget.RelativeLayout
import androidx.core.net.toUri

class SillyImageEditorView : RelativeLayout {
  private val imageView: ImageView

  constructor(context: Context?) : super(context)
  constructor(context: Context?, attrs: AttributeSet?) : super(context, attrs)
  constructor(context: Context?, attrs: AttributeSet?, defStyleAttr: Int) : super(
    context,
    attrs,
    defStyleAttr
  )

  init {
    LayoutInflater.from(context).inflate(R.layout.image_editor, this, true)
    imageView = findViewById(R.id.image_view)
  }

  fun setImage(uri: String) {
    imageView.setImageURI(uri.toUri())
  }
}
```

```xml title="android/src/main/res/layout/image_editor.xml"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
  android:layout_width="match_parent"
  android:layout_height="match_parent"
  android:orientation="vertical">

  <ImageView
    android:id="@+id/image_view"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:layout_centerInParent="true"
    android:padding="16dp"
    android:scaleType="fitCenter"
    tools:srcCompat="@tools:sample/backgrounds/scenic" />

</RelativeLayout>
```

We are using here the classic (now probably _old_) layout resources to paint things on the screen. We are picking this over [Compose](https://developer.android.com/compose), if only to keep the component small (Compose comes as a library that adds to the final bundle size).

If we build our Android app now we will see our first integration working! Any change to the uri prop is properly communicated to the native code.

### iOS

iOS is always a challenge for me, specially because I dread my days coding Objective-C and that's unfortunately the default for native iOS components. Do not fear though, it's possible to keep Objective-C to the bare minimum while moving our views and logic to Swift thanks to [compatibility headers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/importing-swift-into-objective-c).

First things first, open your iOS example with XCode.

```shell
xed example/ios
```

You will be able to edit your native code from the example app by opening the Pods project and looking for the `SillyImageEditor` library in the Development Pods.

![Editing the native library from XCode](/blog/native-components/xcode.png)

<p className="footnote">You don't want to modify the example app iOS code but the library</p>

You will see there are two files, just like in Android, a view manager and the view itself. Both are in Objective-C, and I'm afraid there is little we can do about it. What we can do is to use the Objective-C view class as a shallow indirection to wrap our Swift component, so let's do that.

Let's start by creating a new Swift class, I called mine `SwSillyImageEditorView.swift`. This class will contain all the logic to load the image from the `uri` prop, and the other features we plan to implement. Make sure to add this class to the `ios` directory of your project (not the `example/ios` one). XCode will ask you to create a bridging header, you don't need it (it is used to call Objective-C code from Swift, we are doing the exact opposite). We are also going to load [SnapKit](https://snapkit.github.io/SnapKit/) to build our layout. The reason I'm using SnapKit (which is just a DSL over the classic layout functions in UIKit) rather than [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) is the lack of support for the latter.

üí° I found [this article](https://medium.com/@someSOAP/react-native-fabric-component-using-swiftui-40d692c1baaa) where the author describes the steps to make SwiftUI work but I couldn't make it work myself so I left it out of this guide.

Notes:
- Add a better way to display diffs and load images with react-native-image-picker

Steps:

- Explain the new architecture and what is Fabric (new renderer).
- react-native-builder-bob and create-react-native-library: Explain the two packages and how to run create-react-native-library to create your library (Select Fabric, etc). Explain the project structure (package, example app, etc)
- Sending the URI to the component and loading the image.
- Coding in Kotlin
- Coding in Swift (tweaking the project to work in Swift - https://medium.com/@someSOAP/react-native-fabric-component-using-swiftui-40d692c1baaa)
- Adding a callback
- Sending an event (because not always a state prop is the way to go, for example, responding to a button event in pure react native to change the color of the image randomly).
