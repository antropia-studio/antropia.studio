We have spent some time thinking in and around [our current product framework](https://antropia.studio/blog/whats-worth-building/) and we have some ideas to share.

## Changes to the framework

We have talked with some people and got their feedback. There was one specific point that resonated strongly with our view on building products and that, for some reason, <SideNote note="A confession, I'm mainly a software engineer. Design, product, marketing and more I always considered secondary skills I didn't properly master, and I'm still a bit rusty on those areas. Nothing good and honest friends can't help you with">we accidentally left out of the original plan</SideNote>: **DISTRIBUTION**.

That's why we have included one more rule to the framework:

#### PLAN THE PATH

<div className="flex flex-row gap-2">
  <Tag text="Pride" style="bg-sasquatch-socks/10 text-sasquatch-socks border-sasquatch-socks" />
  <Tag text="Satisfaction" style="bg-hello-summer/10 text-hello-summer border-hello-summer" />
  <Tag text="Organicity" style="bg-benzol-green/10 text-benzol-green border-benzol-green" />
</div>

Identify at least one distribution channel you can execute on. If you can't name it, it's not ready to be built. Plan in increments: how do you get your first customer? Your tenth? Your hundredth? You'll rarely use the same strategy for all of them. Thinking about distribution does not only help make sure the project is sustainable, it also helps you recognize when to stop.

<Callout title="Why" icon="idea">
  Building something nobody finds is worse than building something that fails. Failure teaches you something while invisibility teaches you nothing. And it's not fun.
</Callout>

## What's in our minds?

We have been taking a broad-to-narrow approach. Starting from domains we genuinely care about, whether through experience, frustration or just love. Here is a list of some of the ones we identified:

- **Dogs** - It's no surprise <SideNote note="Shameless plug: my wife runs **guauful.com**, a dog food, snacks, and accessories store for Spain and Portugal">we love dogs</SideNote>, understanding them, and sharing our time with them.
- **Freelancing** - Five years at [Karumi](https://www.karumi.com/), the software studio, and 2 years flying solo.
- **Small businesses** - Did I mention my wife created [the best dog (& cat) store](https://guauful.com/)? She started in Shopify but now has opened a physical store and I loved every step of her journey.
- **Social network** - My relationship with social networks is... difficult. I can see the value in them, but also the terrible incentives they have to [steal our focus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57933306-stolen-focus).
- **Self-hosted community** - We love the community, and we love the philosophy behind it. Some tech companies have destroyed our faith in them over[^1] and over[^2] again[^3]. It's refreshing to see trust-less alternatives to services like Google Photos, Drive, Analytics, Gmail, Buffer, Notion, and more.

### Ideas

We are now in a new phase where we explore these domains to see if we find something we can't stop thinking about. We are sharing them here for transparency, accountability, and why not, because this is how we beat our fear of sharing. Warning: these are not fully fledged, detailed product ideas. For some of them we can already sense their shape, but others still need a ton of definition work to even consider them.

#### Dog professionals scheduling

Trainers, photographers and more, they all need an introduction card (webpage), scheduling sessions, sharing offline work (Trufario?)

#### Small business assistant

Aggregating mail, invoices, shopify data and more to give you insights on how is your day-to-day

#### Freelancer tools

Screen recording for summaries, invoicing and more importantly, taxes.

#### Sane social network

Thinking on aggregating your social networks and include filters, limits, etc.

#### Self-hosted location tracker

## Other pains & domains we are interested in

We have many other interests and we haven't discarded them yet. We like to keep them in mind because maybe we find intersections with other ideas we are researching.

- Pen plotting
- 3d printing
- data journalism
- Boardgames
- Coops
