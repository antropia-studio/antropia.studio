# Lingui - i18n

There are plenty of tools out there for internationalization (i18n), and it can take a while to find one that clicks
with your workflow. For us, that tool turned out to be [Lingui](https://lingui.dev/). It strikes a sweet spot between
flexibility, ease of use, and compatibility in a way that feels just right for my projects. Some of the features I
particularly like are:

- **Rich-text support** - You can define copies inside React tags and the translation will include them for extra
context. Common problems links, bold text or listing items are gracefully resolved using anonymous tags.

<p class="footnote">Lingui includes used tags inside the translation key to make working with rich-text so much
  smoother</p>

- **Plurals support** - Nothing to add here, managing plurals is vital to any i18n effort.
- **Extensibility** - Lingui uses standard formats (`.po`) that can be plugged into your translation workflow easily.

This post isn't a pitch for Linguito though, and itâ€™s more of a journal entry about what building it taught me, the
libraries I used, and why I think tooling plays such a huge role in enjoying the work I do.

So why [Linguito](https://github.com/antropia-studio/linguito)? Well, I've always had a soft spot for tooling - it's like
having a well-organized workshop where everything has its place, and when everything is tidy, you can spend more time in
what really matters. While Lingui is solid as a rock, I noticed some gaps in my workflow that I felt could be easily
addressed:

- **Missing translations** - I've made the mistake of publishing a version (or two) of my apps with untranslated
strings. This happens because it feels very natural to use the final copies while coding, and I often forget about the
extra step of translating them.
- **Context loss** - Catalog files are like words taken out of a conversation, they are stripped from the original
context where strings are used. This makes the translation process a bit rough as you go back and forth between the
app, the code and the string being translated.

On top of that, I can't emphasize how important *tooling* (as a concept) is to me. As someone who loves to kick off new
projects like they are goung out of style, good tooling has become crucial to avoid the groundhog day feeling of doing
the same tasks over and over again. Tooling turns that into a continuous learning process where I can take note of the
things that hurt the most and fix them for the next iteration.

## The implementation

Because talking about how the tool is used would feel too *rtfm-ish* I decided to talk about some of the libraries I
used in this project and how they helped me create Linguito.

### [ts-morph](https://ts-morph.com/)

This library has become one of the most powerful ones in my toolbox. It allows for metaprogramming in Typescript by
wrapping the compiler and exposing methods to read and modify the abstract syntax tree (AST). I've used it so many times
already for some error-prone cases and this has been no different.

The usage of this library in Linguito can be seen as *forced* though, but I promise it solves a real problem I had:
Transforming an external library type hierarchy from classes/interfaces (open, extensible) to types (closed,
discriminated union). I know this will sound meta but the hierarchy is no other than the one defined
in [acorn](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn), a JavaScript parser. As you may imagine, all acorn's AST nodes extend
the [`Node`](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/blob/master/acorn/src/node.js) class, that in turn, transforms into a
Typescript interface.

```ts
export interface Node {
  start: number
  end: number
  type: string
  range?: [number, number]
  loc?: SourceLocation | null
}
```

<p class="footnote">The Typescript's definition of acorn's Node class</p>

This is quite useful when coding the library, but when we move to the type world in Typescript, it becomes quite
hard/cumbersome to work with it in a generic way. For example, defining a variable with type `Node[type]` that infers to
the union `'Identifier' | 'ArrayPattern' | 'ContinueStatement' | ...` is simply not possible. It will always infer the
type of `Node[type]` to be `string`.

How I leveraged ts-morph to solve this? I just
created [a 36-line script](https://github.com/Serchinastico/linguito/blob/main/scripts/build-acorn-node-types.ts) that
finds the type definition of acorn and creates a discriminated union with all interfaces that extend `Node`. The cherry
on top is that this runs after every `npm install` call so this file is always in sync with acorn's definition.

### [acorn](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn)

The already mentioned and popular acorn is a minimalistic JavaScript parser that gives you access to a JavaScript AST
for a given file. Linguito uses it to read Lingui's configuration file and extract all its data in a secure (or
non-regex) way. By reading the config file we are able to get the defined locales, the catalog files location and the
format of the catalog files. For ergonomics reasons I wrapped the tool into my own class that allows me to easily
traverse the AST using only predicates or node names.

```ts
    /* ... */

const ast = await Ast.fromFile(configFilePath)

const exports = ast
  .filterByType('ExportNamedDeclaration')
  .get<VariableDeclaration>('declaration')
  .get<VariableDeclarator>('declarations')

const locales = exports
  .filter((node) => node.id?.type === 'Identifier' && node.id.name === 'locales')
  .get<ArrayExpression>('init')
  .get<Literal>('elements')
  .get('value')

/* ... */
```

  parser](https://github.com/Serchinastico/linguito/blob/main/src/lib/ast/ast.ts)</p>

### [oclif](https://oclif.io/)

My go-to library for building CLI tools. It's not just a library but a framework that helps you with argument parsing,
command taxonomies, error handling, testing and much more.

```
$ linguito --help

CLI tool designed to enhance the capabilities of Lingui

VERSION
  linguito/0.0.0 darwin-arm64 node-v22.12.0

COMMANDS
  check      Check for missing translations in catalog files.
  config     Interactively read and update the app's configuration settings.
  help       Display help for linguito.
  translate  Check for missing translations in catalog files.
```

<p class="footnote">Most of the content displayed here is part of the definition of commands inside the tool and is used
  to build amazing
  CLI experiences</p>

### [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink)

This is the most esoteric library I used for Linguito. Imagine React but in the terminal, that's what Ink does. At first
it felt dirty bringing such a modern piece of technology to the terminal but it ended up solving many usability issues
and making the interactive mode in Linguito a delight.

<p class="footnote">I now feel building this UI without React would have been quite a journey</p>

# My takes

After spending about a week putting all the pieces together, I've had some time to mull over the decisions I made along
the way.

- **Local LLMs first** - I rarely use non-local LLMs for anything other than generic questions. I'm very protective of
my personal data, and I wanted that to reflect on the tool itself. My wish for the future of LLMs is for them to
respect user's privacy at all costs and that includes running local models rather than feeding the data-hungry tech
giants.
- **Open source** - Making Linguito open source wasn't really a choice - it was just the natural way to go. The tool
builds upon other open source projects, and keeping it open means anyone can peek under the hood, learn from my
mistakes (there are plenty), or even better, point out ways to improve it. It's like cooking with the kitchen door
open - you never know who might drop by with a good suggestion for the recipe.
- **Part of the work on the studio** - This is one more building block in the foundation of the studio I'm creating,
making the process of spinning up new React Native prototypes smooth as butter.

Looking back at this little journey, Linguito started as a scratch for my own itch but ended up teaching me quite a bit
about parsing, ASTs, and building proper CLI tools. It's far from perfect - and probably will always be - but it makes
my day-to-day work with translations less of a hassle. If you're working with Lingui and bump into similar pain points,
feel free to give it a shot or contribute your own ideas. The tool is still finding its feet, and I'm curious to see how
it evolves with real-world usage.

Happy translations!
