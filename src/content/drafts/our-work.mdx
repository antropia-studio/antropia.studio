A lot of people reached out since the launch of Antropia asking me how could we help with their idea/project. My goal with this post is to talk about the specific projects we have been involved in, see if any of them resonates with you, and what you can expect from working with us.

Out of respect and privacy for our clients, we are omitting identifiable information of our clients on purpose.

# App #1

Our first client came with a working mobile app with a lot of feedback. They decided to pivot, and in the process, they ditched the app and went to build a new one. We started off by creating a non-functional prototype with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Expo](https://expo.dev/). The app used [fake data](https://github.com/faker-js/faker) to fill in the screens, and it simulated API calls to show loading states and errors. This first prototype gave us a lot of information to take on the next step of the project:

- We were able to **validate entire features** with very little effort. We understood how different parts of the app interacted between them, found potential issues, and managed to find what was the core of the app, without hurting simplicity.
- We **tested** a myriad of user **interactions and components**, how they played together and more importantly, we were able to _feel_ the designs.
- The in-house team was able to build the API blazingly fast. In this phase, the data model and the points of interaction with the backend, were crystal clear.

We evolved the prototype into a fully-fledged app in virtually no time. We found that by using the right abstractions in code, we were able to gradually integrate with the in-progress API seemlessly.
