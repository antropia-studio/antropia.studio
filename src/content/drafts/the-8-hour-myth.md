There's this recurring conversation I've had with myself many times, usually around 3 PM when my brain feels like it's
swimming through molasses. I often started wondering why I was still there, staring at my screen when deep inside me, I
really knew nothing meaningful would emerge from these foggy afternoon hours.

This feeling isn't about laziness or lack of commitment. It's about something more fundamental: the growing disconnect
between how we structure work and how I, and more generally humans, actually function at my best.

Those rare times I've pushed myself into longer days — trying to squeeze out just a bit more — have always left me
feeling miserable. Not accomplished. Not proud. Just depleted, wondering why I thought staring at a screen for extra
hours would magically produce better work.

## The Myth of the Eight-Hour Day

The eight-hour workday is a social fight that goes back to the industrial revolution, where work was designed for
factory floors where human output could be measured in widgets per hour. Spain was the first country that introduced a
law restricting all types of work to a maximum of eight hours a day back in 1919[^1]. **That was more than 100 years
ago**. Since then, workers have fought and won many rights we can thankfully all enjoy today. Still, the 8-hour day is
still deeply engraved in our brains. Its influence is so strong we barely think about it anymore, we work 8-hours
because well... because that's how it is. There has been a recent debate in Spanish politics about lowering the working
hours to 7.5 hours a day[^2], that's huge, but still seems like **an arbitrary value**.

## Research Preface

When I first started writing this section, I was all about reading what the studies said and finding evidence that
suggested that reducing the working hours was, generally, a good idea for society. I soon fell into what I think is the
trap all these studies fall into. They are generally short-sighted and focus on a single variable: **productivity**. I
understand why they do this and why other factors are dismissed or passed over, but this is a clear case
of [Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law) or
the [McNamara fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNamara_fallacy) (both applicable depending on the way you look at
it). We have forgotten the reason we are studying the reduction of work hours and have hyper-fixated on something easily
measurable. We have forgotten that productivity is just a proxy metric for society's well-being.

The philosopher [Byung-Chul Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byung-Chul_Han) writes about our *tiredness society*,
where we've become our own taskmasters, driving ourselves toward burnout in the name of optimization and achievement.
In [*The Burnout Society*](https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=25725), he observes:

> "The tiredness of exhaustion is not a tiredness of positive potency. It is a tiredness that separates and isolates."

This resonates deeply with what I've been experiencing and where my mind automatically drives me when I investigate what
to me is one of the most important matters. The constant push for productivity doesn't just exhaust us — it disconnects
us from ourselves, from others, from the very creativity we're trying to access... and we don't even realize.

## What the Research Tells Us

The science actually backs up what our bodies already know. Cal Newport, in [*Deep
Work*](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/), argues that most knowledge workers can only sustain about 3-4 hours
of truly focused, cognitively demanding work per day. Anders Ericsson's research on elite performers shows they rarely
practice more than 4-5 hours daily[^3]. Beyond that, returns diminish dramatically.

The larger experiments, like Iceland's trial of a 4-day work week (with no reduction in pay) found that productivity
actually increased across 2,500 workers[^4] (I'm well aware of the critiques here regarding not being a true 4-day week
as they *only* reduced weekly hours from 40 to 35). Sweden's experiments with 6-hour workdays showed similar
results[^5] [^6]. Microsoft Japan saw a 40% boost in productivity when they tested a 4-day week[^7].

Beyond these studies, a growing movement of companies, particularly in the IT sector, are taking matters into their own
hands. There is a popular listing of companies called [4 day week](https://4dayweek.io/) that post offers for 4-day
positions, with tech companies leading the charge in proving that less really can be more.

## The paradox

We tell ourselves that working more hours equals more productivity, when data shows the exact opposite. We've
internalized [Parkinson's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law) — that work expands to fill the time
available — but somehow missed its inverse: **constraining time often sharpens focus and output**.

And there's another troubling pattern at play here: a modified version
of [Jevons paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox).
While it's true that workers fought their way from 12-16 hour days during the industrial revolution down to the 8-hour
standard by the early 20th century, something strange happened after that victory. Despite productivity per worker
increasing by over 400% since 1950 in most developed economies, our standard working hours have remained frozen. We've
become 4-5 times more efficient, yet we're still clocking the same hours our great-grandparents did a century ago.
Instead of translating these massive productivity gains into more time for living, we've simply increased
output — creating more, consuming more, **but not living more**.

Finally, let me be clear one more time — **productivity must not be our north star**. We should care far more about
quality of life, time with loved ones, and physical and mental wellbeing. I mention these productivity gains not because
they're the goal, but because they reveal how deeply we've been deceiving ourselves. The metrics that corporations
worship actually improve when we prioritize being human.

## My Own Experiment

Here's what I've been doing for the last year: **capping my workdays at six hours maximum, though most days I work
closer to four**. It's not about rigid schedules or specific start times — it's about recognizing when I've given my
best and having the wisdom to stop. This has become one of the most important rules in Antropia as well.

On top of that, I've started building in purposeful pauses. A walk with my dog when my brain needs to breathe. A trip to
the grocery store or time to prepare a nice meal. These moments of stepping away create space — space where connections
form, where problems untangle themselves, where I can simply exist without the weight of productivity.

The shift has been subtle but profound. My walks with my dog feel different now — not because they're longer or more
frequent, but because **the anxious mental chatter has quieted**. I go grocery shopping and actually notice things:
"*Should I try miso paste? How do I cook it?*". I fix those garage lights that have been broken for months. I have
actual conversations with loved ones — not the exhausted, half-present exchanges that used to pass for connection.
Sometimes I just sit outside with a fiction book, letting my mind wander into someone else's world.

I'm not living a life full of grand adventures or constant travel. That's not what I'm seeking. What I've found instead
is presence in the everyday — a deeper awareness in the simple rhythms of daily life. And that, surprisingly, has led to
a much happier existence.

## The Courage to Change

I'll be honest — this entire post feels scary to write. There's a voice in my head that whispers:
*But what will clients think? What about competition? What about...*

But here's what grounds me: Antropia exists because of a belief in putting people first. We're not machines optimizing
for output. **We're humans creating meaningful work while honoring our full humanity**.

Our clients don't hire us to warm chairs or rack up billable hours. They hire us to solve problems, create beauty, build
systems that work. And we do that better when we're energized, focused, and fully human. When we put people over
everything else — our team, our clients, ourselves — the work naturally improves.

## Moving Forward

This isn't about working less for the sake of it. It's about recognizing that sustainable excellence requires
structuring work around human lives. It's about having the courage to honor our whole selves — the parts that need rest,
play, connection, and meaning beyond our screens.

At Antropia, we're not just building products or delivering services. We're experimenting with what work could be — a
source of meaning and mastery that enhances rather than depletes our lives.

**The question isn't whether we can afford to work this way. The question is whether we can afford not to.**

#### Context and Privilege

This is a reflection of my personal experience, and I'm acutely aware that my answer to the question of working hours
comes from a specific context. Age, life stage, family situation, economic realities — all these factors shape what's
possible for each of us.

I can experiment with working less because I'm in a privileged position. I have a comfortable life without immediate
financial urgencies. My loved ones won't suffer if this experiment fails. Not everyone has this luxury, and I don't want
to pretend that my solution is universal.

The point isn't to prescribe a one-size-fits-all solution, but to question whether our current defaults serve us well
and to imagine what alternatives might be possible within our own circumstances.
